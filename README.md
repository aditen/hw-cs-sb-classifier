# Models Code

This repository contains the code base to deal with the data set that was collected
from Kinderlabor exercise (types). It can be used to analyse the data set as well as to train (DL) models on it.

# TODOs
- Finish cleaner structure (Trainer class, Visualizer class)
  - Trainer: Allow prediction on best model
  - Visualizer: Plot confusion matrix based on test set results (or integrate in trainer)
- Implement data splits with semantic meaning (keeping out students, classes in test set)
- Clean up code, update Readme to explain implemented object model
